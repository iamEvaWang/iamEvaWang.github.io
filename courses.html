                                    <strong>Course Description:</strong> Databases are used to store data and are a core component of many information technology systems. 
                                    Students learn the fundamentals of relational databases design using Entity Relation Diagrams (ERDs), and use Structured Query 
                                    Language (SQL) to create, modify and query a database. Students design and create databases that are maintainable, 
                                    secure and adaptable to change in business requirements, using normalization. Students become familiar with the functions 
                                    of a Database Management System (DBMS) and its components in comparison with legacy systems and alternative information storage mechanisms.

                                    <strong>Course Description:</strong>  The World Wide Web (WWW) has become an integrated part of everyday life. Students develop basic skills of web programming, 
                                    website design and implementation . JavaScript, HTML5, and PHP are used to explore web-based solutions to problems of increasing 
                                    interactivity and complexity. Lectures are reinforced by practical assignments that encourage students to construct and maintain 
                                    their own websites.
